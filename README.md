Ensemble ML models to predict Travel packages
To build ML model to predict Customer Selection to Targeted Campaign
An ensemble of machine learning models was created in this project to predict whether a customer will choose an offered travel package. 
Data Analysis included EDA (Uni/Bivariate analysis), Data preprocessing(Missing and Outliers detection and treatment) and feature engineering(Imputation, OneHot  Encoding). 
Owing to an Imbalanced dataset, stratify algorithm was used. ML Models included Decision Trees, Random Forest and Boosting classifiers such as AdaBoost, Gradient and XGBoost models
and Ensemble of the best performing models. A comparative analysis with Recall metric was performed. Models were Hyper Tuned and Feature Importance was noted.
